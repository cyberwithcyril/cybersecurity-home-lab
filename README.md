# Cybersecurity Home Lab

Welcome to my personal Cybersecurity Home Lab repository. This repository contains vulnerable environments, exploit scripts, notes, and tools I use to practice and develop my penetration testing and security analysis skills.

## 🛠️ Lab Environments and Projects

- **Vulhub**: Containerized vulnerable applications for practicing exploits like authentication bypass, SQL injection, directory traversal, and more.  
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**: Web app for learning OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including XSS, CSRF, and command injection.  
- **Custom Scripts**: Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripts to automate scanning, exploitation, and remediation tasks.  
- **Cloud & Virtualization**: Usage of Azure VMs and VMware for building isolated testing environments.  
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Experience with Tenable for vulnerability assessments and risk prioritization.
